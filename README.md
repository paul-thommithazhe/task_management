# Task Management App â€“ Flutter

A Flutter-based Task Management App built using **Clean Architecture**, **Bloc** for state management, and **Hive** for local persistence.  
The app allows users to create, edit, delete, and sort tasks with a **clean and responsive Material Design UI**.

## Features

- **Task CRUD:** Create, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed.
- **Sorting & Filtering:** Sort tasks by due date or status.
- **Local Persistence:** Uses **Hive** to store tasks locally across app sessions.
- **State Management:** Implements **Bloc** for predictable and maintainable state management.
- **Clean Architecture:** Structured into **Domain, Data, and Presentation layers** for scalability and maintainability.
- **Responsive Design:** Follows Material Design principles to look good on different screen sizes.

## Architecture

- **Domain Layer:** Contains business logic and entities, independent of frameworks/UI.
- **Data Layer:** Manages data sources including **Hive** for local storage and mock API.
- **Presentation Layer:** Handles UI and user interactions using **Bloc**.
